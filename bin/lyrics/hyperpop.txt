Bing, bing, bong.

Kids distracted listen to me while in class, I feel like Tetris.
Themboification poison your mind and body, I'm asbestos.

Classmates swapping Adderall like Smarties in the parking lot.
Wanna act a fool, I brought my scooter to the parking lot.
We could grab our phones and our computers in the parking lot.
Make a movie, it doesn't need to be 3D or 2D.

Hey, you little piss baby.
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?.
You think you're so fucking tough?.
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck.
Aw, look at those arms.
Your arms look so fucking cute, they look like lil' cigarettes.
I bet I could smoke you, I could roast you.
And then you'd love it and you'd text me "I love you".
And then I'd fucking ghost you.

Big boys coming with the big trucks.

Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed.
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead.
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again.
I'm better off alone.

You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me.
You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
When we were together, I tried to tell you.
I used to tap dance when I was in choir.
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed a go-kart.
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it.
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty.
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy.
And you're always busy, so you never hear me.
So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?.
I take it back quick and I nod like, "True".
'Cause you say so many things, and I don't know what I mean.
Short messages to you, short messages to me.
Now if I think of a joke, will I say goodbye?.
I put my paws on my face and pretend to cry.
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you probably think I'm so mean.
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know.
Know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
I guess it's such an easy game, ga-ga-game, ga-ga-game.
If I put you right to sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep.
Rationality could change, cha-cha-change, cha-cha-change.
All in the car, I was asleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep.
Could you explain it all away? (Way-way-way, way-way-way).
Like it was all so clean? (Cle-cle-clean, cle-cle-clean).
So content with all the weight on my back, I forget.
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll pretend it's cool.
And I guess I'll never know.
Know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me me me, me me me.
was trying to find a way to kill time.
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye.
I was trying to find a way to kill time.
Now you're gone, and I can't ever say goodbye.
This feeling's going to my head.
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say.
You circled me inside my room.
I couldn't go another day.
This feeling's going to my head.
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say.
You circled me inside my room.
I couldn't go, go, go, go.
Oh my God, what the fuck.
Take my hand, crush it up.
Spill the blood on the floor.
I ain't scared, think there's more.
What the fuck, make it stop.
Took too long, here right now.
On the floor, in the yard.
Smoking cigs in the bar.
I don't want you to think.
I got bad intentions.
Never wanted you inside.
You made it your mission, yeah (yeah).
Didn't wanna hurt no one (no one).
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun.
Hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride.
She's workin' in my mind.
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough.
You fucked up your last try, last try.
We were in the studio.
I was just playin'.
You were all work and.
I was all play and.
You were talkin' business.
Aiming with your weapon.
I was on your hit list.
I felt the compression.
I'll never go.
I'll haunt your studio.
You won't think of words.
When you write it up.
You'll just hear.
Me singing this song.
You'll think that's okay.
You'll just sing along.
You just copy everything we do.
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too.
You just copy everything we do.
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too.
