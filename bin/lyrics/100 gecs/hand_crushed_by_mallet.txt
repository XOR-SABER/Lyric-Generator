was trying to find a way to kill time.
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye.
I was trying to find a way to kill time.
Now you're gone, and I can't ever say goodbye.
This feeling's going to my head.
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say.
You circled me inside my room.
I couldn't go another day.
This feeling's going to my head.
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say.
You circled me inside my room.
I couldn't go, go, go, go.
Oh my God, what the fuck.
Take my hand, crush it up.
Spill the blood on the floor.
I ain't scared, think there's more.
What the fuck, make it stop.
Took too long, here right now.
On the floor, in the yard.
Smoking cigs in the bar.
I don't want you to think.
I got bad intentions.
Never wanted you inside.
You made it your mission, yeah (yeah).
Didn't wanna hurt no one (no one).
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun.
Hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride.
She's workin' in my mind.
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough.
You fucked up your last try, last try.
We were in the studio.
I was just playin'.
You were all work and.
I was all play and.
You were talkin' business.
Aiming with your weapon.
I was on your hit list.
I felt the compression.
I'll never go.
I'll haunt your studio.
You won't think of words.
When you write it up.
You'll just hear.
Me singing this song.
You'll think that's okay.
You'll just sing along.
You just copy everything we do.
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too.
You just copy everything we do.
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too.
