Gec.
Back once again.
You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me.
You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
When we were together, I tried to tell you.
I used to tap dance when I was in choir.
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed a go-kart.
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it.
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty.
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy.
And you're always busy, so you never hear me.
So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?.
I take it back quick and I nod like, "True".
'Cause you say so many things, and I don't know what I mean.
Short messages to you, short messages to me.
Now if I think of a joke, will I say goodbye?.
I put my paws on my face and pretend to cry.
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you probably think I'm so mean.
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know.
Know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
I guess it's such an easy game, ga-ga-game, ga-ga-game.
If I put you right to sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep.
Rationality could change, cha-cha-change, cha-cha-change.
All in the car, I was asleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep.
Could you explain it all away? (Way-way-way, way-way-way).
Like it was all so clean? (Cle-cle-clean, cle-cle-clean).
So content with all the weight on my back, I forget.
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll pretend it's cool.
And I guess I'll never know.
Know-know-know, know-know-know.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me.
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me me me, me me me.
